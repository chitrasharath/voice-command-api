## 🎯 Your challenge

This repository is the starter template for the **Voice Command API** project.

The frontend is already built. It records up to **20 seconds** of audio in the browser, sends that audio to your backend, and shows:

- the transcription returned by the API
- the final task response returned by the API

Your job is to implement the backend so the full voice-to-action flow works end to end.

---

## How the project works

The frontend uses a single public entry point:

- `POST /transcribe`

The frontend does **not** resolve intents with the Web Speech API. It only captures audio (up to 20 seconds), sends the file to `POST /transcribe`, and shows the backend transcription to make debugging easier.

That endpoint must:

1. receive recorded audio from the frontend
2. transcribe it to text
3. reuse the same routing logic as `POST /instruction`
4. execute the corresponding task action in memory
5. return the transcription, the instruction payload, and the final result

Your backend must also expose:

- `POST /instruction`
- `GET /tasks`
- `POST /tasks`
- `PUT /tasks/{task_id}`
- `PATCH /tasks/{task_id}`
- `DELETE /tasks/{task_id}`

Important:

- Use **in-memory storage only**. No database and no files.
- The frontend is provided and should not be modified as part of the exercise.
- The backend included in this repository is only a template. You must implement the missing logic.

## 🌱 How to start the project

You can open this project in [GitHub Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/4GeeksAcademy/voice-command-api) or clone it locally.

If you use Codespaces, the repository already includes a `.devcontainer` prepared for Python, Node, FastAPI, and Vite.

### Option A: GitHub Codespaces

1. Open the repository in Codespaces.
2. Wait for the dev container to finish installing dependencies.
3. Create `.env` from `.env.example`.
4. Create `frontend/.env` from `frontend/.env.example`.
5. Run the backend and frontend from the terminal tabs.

### Option B: Local setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/voice-command-api
cd voice-command-api
```

Create your own repository and update the remote:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY
```

### Backend setup

Create a `.env` file from `.env.example` and fill in your Groq credentials.

Install dependencies and run the API:

```bash
pipenv install
pipenv run uvicorn src.main:app --reload
```

### Frontend setup

Create `frontend/.env` from `frontend/.env.example`.

Run the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 💻 What you need to do

- [ ] Create a module-level `tasks` list with `id`, `title`, and `done`, using unique incremental IDs.
- [ ] Implement `GET /tasks`, `POST /tasks`, `PUT /tasks/{task_id}`, `PATCH /tasks/{task_id}`, and `DELETE /tasks/{task_id}` using in-memory state.
- [ ] Implement `POST /instruction` to receive `{ "transcription": "..." }`, call Groq, and return **only** routing JSON (no task execution):

```json
{
  "endpoint": "/tasks",
  "method": "POST",
  "params": { "title": "Buy groceries" }
}
```

- [ ] Implement `POST /transcribe` to accept `multipart/form-data`, convert audio to text, reuse `/instruction` logic, execute the selected action, and return `transcription`, `instruction`, and `result`.
- [ ] Do not hardcode intent matching with manual rules such as `if "add" in text`.

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** The frontend does not resolve intents with Web Speech API. It only captures audio (up to 20 seconds), sends it to `POST /transcribe`, and shows backend transcription to debug STT vs. routing issues.

```json
{
  "transcription": "add buy groceries to my list",
  "instruction": {
    "endpoint": "/tasks",
    "method": "POST",
    "params": {
      "title": "Buy groceries"
    }
  },
  "result": {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Buy groceries",
    "done": false
  }
}
```

## Debugging tip

If the transcription shown in the frontend is already wrong, the problem is in the audio capture or speech-to-text step.

If the transcription is correct but the action is wrong, the problem is in `/instruction`.

---

## ✅ What we will evaluate

- [ ] `POST /transcribe` accepts audio, transcribes it, and reuses `/instruction` routing logic.
- [ ] `POST /instruction` receives plain text and returns only routing JSON (no action execution).
- [ ] `GET /tasks`, `POST /tasks`, `PUT /tasks/{task_id}`, `PATCH /tasks/{task_id}`, and `DELETE /tasks/{task_id}` work correctly with in-memory state.
- [ ] The frontend displays the transcription returned by the backend to help distinguish STT errors from routing errors.

## 📦 How to submit this project

1. Push your solution to your GitHub repository.
2. Make sure backend and frontend are included and runnable locally.
3. Share the repository URL and a short video/GIF showing:
   - audio recording (20 seconds max),
   - transcription visible in the frontend,
   - correct task action execution.
